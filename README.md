ok so the plan is
 - simulation
   - have money builds over time
   - allow building of roads, cost proportional to distance. benefit = ?
 - simulate building roads and changing faction based on accessibility etc
 - cities also have production inputs and outputs, trade etc
 - see if simulation can be non retarded
 - e.g. a city will turn independent if its not got a nearby, strong power influencing it
 - add more terrain considerations like rivers etc

hmm making a game with a custom vector engine, like a space game, wouldnt that be cool

prebuilt highways might be spicy

Sooooooooooo

it looks like the library sorts the points by y value.
When you pick they are sorted by y value.
But adjacency seems to use 


maybe its the difference between get locaiton and look up vs get position straight off it
ask: what are ur neighbours X? retarded
ask: are u a neighbour of X? ok

maybe retardation just cancels out

anyway still if I sort points by Y will that fix it. maybe just do that and move on with my life
